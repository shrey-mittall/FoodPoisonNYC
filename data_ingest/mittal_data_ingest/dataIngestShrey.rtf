\f0\fs48 \cf0 Import the original datasets from NYC Data into the HPC using a curl command and url, since they will take too long if you upload them from local host into the SSH portal. Then, run the MapReduce function on the csv file to produce the cleaned version. This will be placed into home directory in HDFS, and then can be accessed by the Scala program when run. Same goes for Ryan\'92s file, which will come out of his MapReduce code and then placed into the HDFS home directory.  }
